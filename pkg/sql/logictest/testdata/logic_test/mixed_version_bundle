# This is a sanity check that stmt bundle collection works around the
# V25_2_AddUsernameToStmtDiagRequest migration. Note that we don't inspect the
# contents of the bundles (this is done elsewhere), so the check here is simply
# that the bundle can be collected.

# Insert a diagnostics request that won't be completed and never expires.

# polling goroutine gracefully handles the mixed-version state too. We'll also
# sleep for 1s in each state to ensure the polling loop has at least one chance
# to run on each node.

# - cluster is at old version
# - cluster is at mixed version, gateway is at old version
# - cluster is at mixed version, gateway is at new version
# - cluster is at new version.
