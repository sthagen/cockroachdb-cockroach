# This test is similar to skewed_cpu_skewed_write.txt, but with more ranges 300. 
# To have the same amount of total load, bytes per range is reduced to 26 MiB.
# 
# Expected outcome: The allocator should rebalance both cpu and write load across
# all stores, with mma achieving better results than sma.

# The placement will be skewed, s.t. n1/s1, n2/s2 and n3/s3 will have all the
